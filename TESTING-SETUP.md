## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run tests locally
npm test

# Run tests in CI mode
npm run test:ci

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Build for production
npm run build:prod

# Security audit
npm run audit
```

## Pipeline Features

### PR Validation Pipeline
✅ Automated testing on pull requests  
✅ Build verification  
✅ Security audit  
✅ Branch protection integration  

### Full CI/CD Pipeline
✅ Comprehensive testing with coverage  
✅ Production build  
✅ Artifact publishing

## Test Coverage Goals
- **Statements**: 80%
- **Branches**: 75%  
- **Functions**: 80%
- **Lines**: 80%

## Next Steps for Team

1. **Setup Azure DevOps**:
   - Import repository to Azure DevOps
   - Create new pipeline using `azure-pipelines.yml`
   - Configure branch policies

2. **Team Onboarding**:
   - Share `SETUP-GUIDE.md` with all team members
   - Ensure everyone can run tests locally
   - Verify pipeline access and permissions

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Consider adding ESLint configuration
   - Add E2E tests with Cypress or Playwright
   - Implement code formatting with Prettier

4. **Advanced Features** (Optional):
   - Deployment stages for different environments
   - Integration with SonarQube for code quality
   - Automated dependency updates with Dependabot

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section in `SETUP-GUIDE.md`
2. Verify Node.js version (should be 20.x)
3. Ensure Chrome is installed for testing
4. Check Azure DevOps permissions and service connections
